      <h2>Problem statement</h2>

      <p>
        Data available online related to notarial offices, and translators and interpreters, is lackluster. An individual might expect to find a web application, or otherwise, that centralizes available data about the two respective entities.
        Data such as:
          <ul>
            <li>reviews;</li>
            <li>rates;</li>
            <li>provided services;</li>
            <li>location;</li>
            <li>contact details;</li>
          </ul>
        Ideally, the application will build on top of its existent data sources by incorporating into them data provided by its users. The first type of data that one might arrive at, and that is of great interest to today's internet user,
        is represented by reviews. In the current case, reviews of notarial offices, translators and interpreters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such an application does not currently exist in the Romanian internet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Red Tape Reviewer is an attempt to solve the presented issues. The main purpose of the application is centralization of existent publicly available data (using the data stored on <a href="https://data.gov.ro/dataset" target="_blank"><span property="schema:url">data.gov</span></a> website), and data obtained during the lifespan of the application (e.g. reviews from the 
        app's users), and sharing all of it through a web portal.

      <h2>Functional and Technical Specifications (Pre-Implementation)</h2>

      <h3>Functional Specifications</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Individuals can create an account;</li>
        <li>Expose a web portal for displaying collected data about notarial offices, translators and interpreters;</li>
        <li>The user can contribute to the data gathering by providing one or more of the following:
          <ul>
            <li>a review of an office entity;</li>
            <li>the location of an office entity, if missing;</li>
            <li>rates and services provided by an office entity, if missing;</li>
            <li>timetable of an office entity, if missing;</li>
            <li>contact information for an office entity, if missing.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>A review contains:
        <ul>
          <li>reviewed entity data;</li>
          <li>score;</li>
          <li>title, optional;</li>
          <li>description, optional.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Technical Specifications</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Application's UI is written in React and deployed through the means of a static resources hosting service provided by a cloud vendor;</li>
        <li>Application's backend is represented by a series of independent services deployed in different containers on a single server, or on multiple servers altogether;</li>
        <li>Data is persisted NonSQL database provided by a cloud services vendor.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Architecture</h2>

      <p>The application architecture's is based on SOA. There exists a collection of independent services that perform the application's business logic. All layers of the application (UI, business logic, and data) are deployed or hosted through the means of AWS cloud vendor:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the UI is hosted on the S3 service;</li>
        <li>the services are deployed through the EC2 service;</li>
        <li>the data is persisted through the DynamoDB service.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Flow</h3>

      <p>The application's flow is simple:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>user logs in or creates an account;</li>
        <li>once logged in, the user can search for entities;</li>
        <li>once logged in, the user can submit a review for an entity.</li>
      </ol>

      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="./flow.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Fig 1.0. Application Flow Chart</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>UI Layer</h3>

      <p>The client-side layer of the application is written in React. React-Router is used for the implementation of routing inside of the client.</p>

      <h4>Components</h4>

      <p>There are 3 pages that compose the application:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>/authentication</code> handles account creation and accessing the application;</li>
        <li><code>/index</code> is the homepage. Exposes notaries, translators and interpreters entities, along with a filtering mechanism;</li>
        <li><code>/entity/[entity-id]</code> is the page that can be navigated to from inside of <code>/index</code>. It represents a detailed view of the entity with id <code>[entity-id]</code>. Here, the user can add and read reviews, and locate detailed information about the entity's provided services in question, and see contact information for the entity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Interaction with the backend services</h4>

      <p>In the case of backend APIs integration, the desired effect is decoupling. To achieve this, the UI is limited to interacting with one single service: API Gateway Service. The service will pre-process, map or modify the data in any way it is necessary for modeling it such that it matches the interface that the frontend expects.</p>
    
      <h3>Backend Services</h3>

      <p>The Backend of the application is split into 4 separate services, described in the following diagram:</p>

      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="./backend-now.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Fig 1.1. Backend Structure</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Each service is deployed separately.</p>

      <h4>API Gateway Service</h4>

      <p>The purpose of this service is acting as a gateway between the UI and the other services. The functionalities of this service are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>intercept all requests from the UI;</li>
        <li>pass requests to Model and User services and transform the data such that it is in accordance with the expected interface on the UI side;</li>
        <li>handle particularities related to browser-based client to server communication (e.g. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, Cross-Site Request Forgery protection). This particular functionality will ensure that the other services are not to be configured to support request-handling for a browser-based client. This will simplify the amount of configuration that needs to be done. Additionally,the DRY principle is respected.</li>
      </ul>

      <figure typeof="sa:image">
        <img src="./api-gateway.jpg" />
        <figcaption>Fig 1.2. API Gateway Structure</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h4>User Service</h4>

      <p>All functionalities related to account creation, account management and log-in.</p>

      <p>In the same domain as this service, basic authentication will be implemented.</p>

      <h4>Model Service</h4>

      <p>This service exposes the API for creating, reading, updating and deleting entities (notaries, translators and interpreters). Because of this, it is the service that interacts most with the data layer.</p>

      <p>For reading (accessing) the entities from the database, the Model service exposes the necessary endpoints.</p>
      <p>The service can be used to access entities regardless of any attributes that they might have, with a basic pagination functionality such that not all entities need to be queried  at the same time.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the service exposes an API for searching for entities based on a number of criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>number of reviews;</li>
        <li>rating;</li>
        <li>name;</li>
        <li>location;</li>
        <li>provided services;</li>
        <li>tariffs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The service also exposes an endpoint for updating entities. The purpose of the endpoint is registering updates from users regarding a certain entity:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reviews;</li>
        <li>location;</li>
        <li>rates and services;</li>
        <li>contact information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Poller Service</h4>

      <p>Because the application is reliant on the government data available to the public regarding notaries, translators and interpreters, there must exist a way for the application to query the data source at regular intervals and to update its data layer with new information, if present. This need is filled by the Poller service.</p>
      <p>The service's purpose is polling the APIs exposed at <code>https://data.gov.ro/api/3/action/package_show/[dataset-id]</code> and, if the data is different from the last time the endpoint was queried, update the data layer to reflect the change. In this way, Red Tape Reviewer's users will always have access to the latest official data.</p>

      <p>The service implements an additional functionality: csv files parsing. The service will download and parse the files and fill the data layer accordingly. On each data update, the prior files will be deleted and replaced with the newly downloaded files.</p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h3>Entities</h3>

      <p>This section will describe all of the entities and sub-entities present in the application (user, notarial office, translator-interpreter office, review, service).</p>

      <h4>User</h4>

      <code>
        User {
          id: string
          email: string
          password: string
          username: password
          reviews: Review[]
        }
      </code>

      <p>Describing individuals that can create accounts, and contribute to the store of information with new data about the other two entities and reviews.</p>

      <p>This entity is managed by the User service, and a new instance of it is created for each account.</p>

      <p>The user's reviews are identified by the <code>reviews</code> field.</p>

      <h4>Office: notarial or translator-interpreter</h4>

      <code>
        <p>Office {<p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">id: string</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">averageRating: double</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">reviews: Review[]</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">name: string</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">location: {</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">city: string</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">county: string</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">streetName: string</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">streetNumber: string</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">floor: string</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">}</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">contact: {</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">phoneNumber: string[]</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">emailAddress: string[]</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">}</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">type: string</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">services: Service[]</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">timetable: {</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 32px">string[2]</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16px">}[]</p>
        <p>}</p>
      </code>

      <p>The purpose of each field of the Office entity can be explained as follows:
        <ul>
          <li><code>averageRating</code> - the grade of this entity, calculated as an average of the <code>rating</code> field of every Review associated to this office;</li>
          <li><code>reviews</code> - an array of reviews addressed to this office;</li>
          <li><code>name</code> - a non-unique identifier;</li>
          <li><code>location</code> - dictionary of fields describing the geographical location of this office;</li>
          <li><code>contact</code> - data regarding the contact channels for this particular office;</li>
          <li><code>type</code> - represents the type of office, which can be: <code>notarial</code> for a notarial office, or <code>translator-interpreter</code> for a translator-interpreter office;</li>
          <li><code>services</code> - a list of the services that the office provides;</li>
          <li><code>timetable</code> - a list with all of the days of the week and their respective working hours interval for this office.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Sub-entities</h4>

      <p>The following are entities that are not returned directly by any backend service. Instead, they help reason about the primary elements of an Office entity (reviews and services).</p>

      <h5>Review</h5>

      <code>
        Review {
          id: string
          rating: int
          title: string
          comment: string
          userId: string
        }
      </code>

      <p>The following describes the purpose of each field:
        <ul>
          <li><code>rating</code> - the grade that a user has specified for this review, from 1 to 5;</li>
          <li><code>title</code> - the title of the review;</li>
          <li><code>comment</code> - further comments in this review, optional field;</li>
          <li><code>userId</code> - represents the <code>id</code> field of the User entity that created the review;</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The Review entity is not directly returned by any of the backend services. Instead, the purpose of all of the Review entities is being stored together with NotarialOffice and TranslatorInterpreterOffice entities to which they belong to.</p>

      <h5>Service</h5>

      <code>
        Service {
          id: string
          title: string
          descriptionOfService: string
          price: double
        }
      </code>

      <p>This entity refers to individual services that an Office might perform (e.g. mandarin translation, ancient text interpretation, real estate purchase mediation, etc.).</p>

      <h3>Preliminary Difficulties: Missing Data on data.gov</h3>

      <p>This section describes one of the difficulties that was encountered when designing the application and the approach taken to solve it. The problem is that of missing data.</p>

      <p>The application's primary data source (<code>data.gov</code>) does not expose all of the information that would be needed for a complete representation of the entities in the UI.</p>
      <p>
        The available data is missing crucial information as well, such as location in the case of translator-interpreter offices, and provided services in case of notarial offices.
        There is also no trace of reviews, rates, specializations, vicinity between offices, maps, timetables or full contact information. Fortunately, Red Tape Reviewer tries to solve this exact problem.
        The goal for Red Tape Reviewer is serving as a public data store, continuously collecting information from its users, on behalf of its users. Users can contribute to the collected data by specifying certain information
        about one or more entities, such as: contact information, timetables, reviews, location, and other types of information that is related to one entity.
      </p>

      <p>Such an approach is similar to that taken by the <span property="schema:Organization"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank"><span property="schema:name">Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia</span> website</a></span>.</p>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Linked Data Principles Adherence</h3>

      <p>All entities in the application will be exposed through a URI such as: <code>http://red-tape-reviewer.com/[entity-type]/[entity-id]</code>, where <code>[entity-type]</code> can be user, office, etc., and <code>[entity-id]</code> represents the unique identifier of the searched entity. 
      This pattern of URI representation is used in the application's APIs and is inspired by object-based navigation.</p>

      <p>The used protocol for the application's APIs is HTTP.</p>

      <p>The payload between the API Gateway Service and the client will conform to the JSON format. For communication between business modules, the sent payloads will be under the format of RDF*. 
      This approach was chosen, particularly JSON formatting for backend-client payloads, to leverage existing capabilities of JavaScript (which the client-side application is written in) in parsing JSON in the browser.</p>
      
      <p>Similar to RESTful APIs' HATEOAS, each HTTP payload related to an entity will hold URIs to related entities.</p>

      <p>In Red Tape Reviewer, the principle manifests itself as in the following example: an office entity holds a <code>neighbors</code> field, that keeps references to geographically close entities of the same type (e.g. notarial offices);</p>

  <!-- TODO: 
    talk about difficulties with the polling service: WCU limitations and cost, need of throttling for keeping WCUs under some amount a second (currently 5) so we don't get billed a lot and because we had only provisioning of 1 WCU per second when we first created the table, massive oversight that lead to a lot of scary errors in the AWS console





    how to identify stale items? As of now I do not know. If we don't get rid of stale items, we add a lot of garbage data to the app. If we do get rid of stale items, how do we do it? 
    We would need to consume a lot of RCUs for verifying each item, and then additional WCUs to delete the stale items, I ain't got the cash... 
    POSSIBLE ANSWER: the conclusion that I arrived at was that we can create a hash that takes as inputs the fields in the excel from data.gov 
    (so two fields ALEXANDRA DAMIR, BUCURESTI will produce the hash ALEXANDRADAMIRBUCURESTI (consider using a more advanced hashing algorithm for better unpredictable IDs <- talk about this too)) 
    and use it as ID of the element in the DB. The result of this is: we don't have to delete any items, because we're doing
    a PUT operation, such that only new items will be added to the DB, so we're saving a lot of resources because we don't need to drop the table and all that, but.... There is a high possibility that the
    data in our DB will be different from the data from data.gov... Keep in mind that if the entity is updated (by the user, with other fields (e.g. address)), 
    you have to delete the existing entity, create a new hash and create a new entity with the old fields + the updated fields. This solution is only done because we have to deal with updating the data with data.gov,
    but it also means that the data can be updated only by addition, no deletion and no item update (if something changed in data.gov a new item will be created). This problem is because there is no static identifier
    for entries on data.gov, even the authorization number for translators can be changed if they change their name for instance... This will lead to a lot of redundant data. I think this is the best option right now...

    POSSIBLE ANSWER (WRONG - see comment below): we could reserve a downtime for our app in which it will not be available. Like bank apps are doing: We're gonna be down for maintenance or something like that. In that downtime, all the items are deleted and then the new items are placed in the DB

    POSSIBLE ANSWER (WRONG - see comment below): we could create a new table with new data, drop the old table, and update the app to use the new table

    COMMENT: The last two options are gonna delete the reviews... so no go. We need to keep the same items.
